 *  in the splash screen as well as plug into the about box.
 *
 *  To show up in the splash screen or the about box you need to have an entry
 *  in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\7.0\InstalledProducts.  Your registry
 *  key under InstalledProducts ought to be your product name with no spaces
 *  (i.e. VisualC++).
 *
 *  Although you can plug into the about box by simply putting the appropriate
 *  entries into the registry, since everybody in the splash screen presumably
 *  also wants to be in the about box, it made sense to add an about box
 *  properties to this interface.

//This is the recommended size for the splash screen bitmaps.  This should

//in the 88x70 rect.  Bitmaps should have a background of 0x0000fe00 (one
//off of the standard green, so you can use the standard green in your
//bmp if you want)
//Bitmaps should be no more than 256 colors.
//You will only see your bitmap on the splash screen after you've done
//a devenv /setup
